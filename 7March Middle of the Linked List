/*
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100

Complexity:

Time complexity:
Calculating the length of the linked list takes O(n) time.
Traversing halfway through the list also takes O(n/2) time.
Overall time complexity is O(n).

Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space proportional to the size of the input.
